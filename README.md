Roll Call is a completely freeðŸŽ‰ voice chat service with podcast
quality recording.

It's entirely Open Source and can be embedded into your own web pages
and web applications.

For more information on how to use Roll Call check out the
[FAQ](https://rollcall.audio/faq.html).

## Embedding

Roll Call can easily be embedded on your own website. The easiest way is
with a script include.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/roll-call@latest/dist/rollcall.js"></script>
<my-container>
  <roll-call call="myUniqueCallIdentifier"></roll-call>
</my-container>
```

Roll Call uses WebComponents. This means that you can use it like
any other HTML element and manipulate its state with JavaScript.

Or, if you want to build it into the JavaScript bundle for your own app
you can do so easily, but you'll need to handle loading a WebComponents
polyfill for most browsers on your own.

```javascript
const { Call } = require('roll-call')

let elem = new Call()
elem.call = 'myUniqueCallIdentifier'
document.body.appendChild(elem)
```

Once you require the script the elements are registered so you could also
do something like this.

```javascript
require('roll-call')

document.body.innerHTML += `<roll-call call="myUniqueCallIdentifier"></roll-call>`
```

## To Develop

```
